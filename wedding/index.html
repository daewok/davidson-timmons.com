<p>The park opens at 10:00 AM, with the ceremony starting at 11:00 AM, followed by
a reception. When you arrive at the park, tell them you are attending our
wedding (so that we can take care of your entrance fee).</p>

<h2 id="dress-code">Dress Code</h2>

<p>Dressy casual or cocktail attire (suits or nice pants &amp; shirt, dresses);
footwear that will let you celebrate whether you&rsquo;re out on the grass or the
dance floor with us.</p>

<h2 id="extra-notes">Extra Notes</h2>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Children are completely welcome, just make sure to include them on the RSVP!</li>
<li>There is no smoking on the park property.</li>
<li>The park closes at twilight for anyone not camping over night.</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel">
    <h2 id="airports">Airports</h2>

<p>If you are flying to our wedding, there are three airports nearby. Each is a 2+
hour drive from the park, so we suggest arriving in the area at least one day
before the wedding.</p>

<ul>
<li>Boston (BOS). ~3 hour drive, largest airport in the area, likely the easiest
to fly into.</li>
<li>Manchester, NH (MHT). ~2 hour drive. Small airport without many direct
flights.</li>
<li>Burlington, VT (BTV). ~2 hour drive. Small airport without many direct
flights.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lodging">Lodging</h2>

<p>There are a number of hotel and AirBnB options within a couple minute drive of
the park. For more hotel information, check out:</p>

too!)</p>

<h2 id="gifts">Gifts</h2>

<p>Thank you for celebrating our wedding with us! Your presence on our special day
is all of the gift we need &lt;3.</p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;d like to give us a gift, we are lucky to have almost everything
that we need! The best gift would be support of our honeymoon to Greece, or for
purchasing a few framed pictures from our wedding.</p>

<p>If you prefer to give us a physical gift, there are also a few things we could
still use for our home:</p>
